# Exploring-FDM-Techniques-for-Audio-Transmission  
The FDM Techniques for Audio Transmission project is an exploration of frequency division multiplexing (FDM) for transmitting and receiving audio signals. This project involves the modulation and demodulation of audio signals using FDM techniques, allowing for the transmission of multiple audio signals simultaneously over a single channel.  

## Installation  
To use this project, you will need to have MATLAB and Simulink installed on your system.   Once you have MATLAB and Simulink installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine.  

### Usage
To run the FDM-based audio system-   Open the _FDM_MATLAB.m_ file in MATLAB or Simulink.   This file contains the simulation model of the FDM-based audio system, including the modulation and demodulation components.  You can adjust the parameters of the system and the input audio signals as needed.
